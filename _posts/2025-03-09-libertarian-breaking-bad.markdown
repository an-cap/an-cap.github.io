## The nature of crime

There are two types of crimes that are prosecuted today:

1. Crimes with victims
2. Victimless crimes

Crimes with victims are crimes in which one violates the rights of another. Some examples of crimes with victim include:

- Murdering someone
- Raping someone
- Stealing something
- Defrauding someone
- Violating a contractual agreement

Some examples of victimless crimes include:

- Homosexuality
- Blasphemy
- Doing drugs

Crimes with victims are considered to be crimes because they involve violating someone's property right or violating a legally binding contract. Thus, it makes sense that these are crimes. 

Victimless crimes, on the other hand, are harder to justify. What is the justification for criminalizing homosexuality? In the realm of property rights, there is none. Homosexuality does not directly or indirectly victimize anyone. If one wants to be insulated from it's effects, one needs only to not engage in homosexual activity. 

The same is true of blasphemy and other thought crimes. A religion person has none of their rights violated due to the existence of an atheist or a person of different religious beliefs. If blasphemy is distressing to them, they need only not listen to it. 

The problem with the category of victimless crimes is that the mere existence of a "victimless crime" poisons the term crime and removes any use it can have. A crime must have a perpetrator and a victim. The perpetrator must violate the rights of the victim. The victim and perpetrator cannot be the same person. **This is the only meaningful way to define the term "crime".** Defining crime as something that the state dictates against is to kill the meaning of the word. If the state decides that rape is not a crime, is the state right in this judgment? It isn't **because crime is not dictated by the state**.

Thus we arrive at this definition for crime:

* Crime P, V = 
     1. Any action committed by P that violates the rights of V
     2. Contract (agreed upon by P and V) that P violates

## Doing drugs

If crime is an action that violates the actions of another or violates a contract, then doing drugs is not a crime.

There are two good arguments against this position:

1. Doing drugs has negative effect on one's health (it is a crime wherein the victim and perpetrator are the same person)
2. Doing drugs increases the probability one will commit legitimate crimes.

I will address both.

### Counterpoint 1: doing drugs harms the person who did them

This argument fails because self-harm is not a crime. The key aspect of a crime and the reason why it needs a different person as victim is consent. Someone murdering someone is doing so without his consent. If he was, he would be administering medical assistance in dying (MAID).[^1] 

Self-harm as a crime is a ridiculous concept. If we accept as true the idea that self-harm qualifies as a crime than giving someone money should be considered a crime akin to stealing. Why? The only difference between these crimes is that the perpetrator of the crime happens to be the victim. However, when someone donates his money, he has consented to the implied effect of his money being donated. This is very simple.

[^1]: There is still public debate as to whether MAID is ethical or not. There shouldn't be. The state does not have the right to elongate the painful life of a sick man or woman. Doing so is a cruel torture that is not remotely moral.

Additionally, drugs like cigarettes do more harm that mild illegal drugs like marijuana. Yet no one considers smoking a cigarette to be a crime even though it involves self-harm. 

### Counterpoint 2: Doing drugs increases the probability one will commit crime

I am not familiar with whether or not this statement is factually true or not. Some drugs may cause people to be more likely to pursue reckless or criminal behavior. Some may not. I don't know. Even assuming the universal truth of this statement, this does not make drug consumption a crime. People are more likely to kill people when they drive. The average car driver almost certainly kills more people and causes more property damage than the average pedestrian or train passenger, yet driving is not a crime. Why isn't it a crime? Millions would be alive today if it were a crime. Every year about one million and around three hundred thousand people die as a result of car crashes. Yet no one, aside from a few leftist morons, suggests the banning of cars and driving.

Let's take it further. Why isn't being angry illegal? Being angry makes the brain think in an extremely impulsive and irrational way. Most adults can control their emotions. Let's employ the coercive power of the state to outlaw the emotion of anger! 

Arguments like this can and are used to justify totalitarianism. We must realize the moral catastrophe one imposes on himself and others by following these arguments to their logical conclusions.
